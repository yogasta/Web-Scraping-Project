## Project Overview

This project aims to scrape book information from the Books to Scrape website using three different Python libraries. Each implementation extracts the following data for each book:

-   Title
-   UPC
-   Product Type
-   Price (excluding tax)
-   Price (including tax)
-   Tax
-   Availability
-   Number of reviews

## Requirements

-   Python 3.7+
-   pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    
    bash
    
    Copy
    
    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-project.git cd web-scraping-project`
    

2.  Install the required packages:
    
    bash
    
    Copy
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    

## Usage

Each implementation can be run separately. See the [Implementations](#implementations) section for specific usage instructions.

## Implementations

### BeautifulSoup

The BeautifulSoup implementation is contained in `beautifulsoup_scraper.py`.

To run:

bash

Copy

`python beautifulsoup_scraper.py`

This script uses `requests` to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content. It scrapes book data page by page and saves the results to a CSV file.

### Scrapy

The Scrapy implementation is a separate project within the `scrapy_project` directory.

To run:

bash

Copy

`cd scrapy_project scrapy crawl books`

This implementation uses Scrapy's spider framework to crawl the website efficiently. It defines item types and uses pipelines for data processing.

### Selenium

The Selenium implementation is contained in `selenium_scraper.py`.

To run:

bash

Copy

`python selenium_scraper.py`

This script uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the website dynamically. It's useful for websites that require JavaScript rendering.

## Output

Each implementation saves the scraped data to a CSV file in the project root directory:

-   BeautifulSoup: `Beautiful_Soup_Scrape.csv`
-   Scrapy: `Scrapy_Output.csv`
-   Selenium: `Selenium_Scrape.csv`
